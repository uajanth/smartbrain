This project was a part of the "Zero To Mastery - Complete Web Developer in 2022: Zero to Mastery" course. I changed the styling to my liking, and additionally used functional components to create this application. This application was created using the ReactJS framework for the frontend, NodeJS for the backend and a PostgreSQL database. Please be aware that this application was deployed for production using Heroku's free plan, so expect connectivity issues occasionally.
